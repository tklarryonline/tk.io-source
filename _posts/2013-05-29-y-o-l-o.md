The two old-boys, after hearing people scream "YOLO", looked at each other:

**TK**: *You only live once?*

**L**: *You obviously lack originality!*

**TK**: *Yup! Obviously! Lemonade? One?*

**L**: (Yelling out loud) *Orange!!!!*

**TK**: *You'd only like orange?!*

**L**: *Yes, orange! Lemon? Ouch!*

**TK**: (...)

**L**: *Your orange looks odd?!*

**TK**: *Your orange-lemonade's on!*

**L**: *Yerk! Orange-lemonade? Okay...*

**TK**: (...)

**L**: (...)
<br/>
**TK**: I'm done with this YOLO stuff...

**L**: Me too =.=
